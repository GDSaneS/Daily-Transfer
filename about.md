# Daily Transfer

Have you ever tried to click those pesky icons, and ended up opening the Rewards Tab?

Now you can place the Daily chest below the Play button!

# Features (v1.1.0)

- The Daily button is moved right below the Play button, **it can be disabled**.

- Compatibility setting "Transfer Full Column": every button on the right gets moved below the Play button!

(v1.1.1) -> You can now modify the gap between the buttons

That's it for now!

Requests for more silly changes appreciated ^^

# Compatibility

- `GDTweaks` (compatible with all but "Replace More Games" setting)
- `Better Menu` (compatible with all but "Right Menu to Shortcuts" setting)
- `Texture Loader` and most mods that a button to the side
- **WARNING** `Backup` mod breaks mine if you enable "Button In Options Menu" (I could fix it, but not yet)
