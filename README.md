# Daily Transfer

Have you ever tried to click those pesky icons, and ended up opening the Rewards Tab?

Now you can place the Daily chest below the Play button!

# Features

- The Daily button is moved right below the Play button, it can be disabled.
Yeah that's it.

Tested it on many aspect ratios and it doesn't cause any overlapping.

Requests for more silly changes appreciated c:

# Compatible with
